# Deep-into-CNN
Repository is for recruitment test in summer projects of programming club, IIT kanpur.
Here, I have implemented Linear Regression using python and numpy. 
I considered a random dataset of **"Chances of admission in university"** on the basis of following parameters- <br /><br />
**1) GRE Score**<br />
**2) TOEFL Score**<br />
**3) University Ranking**<br />
**4) SOP**<br />
**5) LOR**<br />
**6) CGPA**<br />
**7) Research**<br /><br />
Finally, we have our dependent variable as **Chance of Admit**. <br />
We will use Normal Equation for Estimation of Coefficients.
